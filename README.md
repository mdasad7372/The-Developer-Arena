🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction
📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the value of a residential property based on its features such as location, number of bedrooms, area (sq ft), amenities, and property age.
It uses Machine Learning techniques to train a model on historical property data and evaluate its performance using RMSE and MAE.

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

Location – City or area of the property

Bedrooms – Number of bedrooms

Area (sq ft) – Total built-up area

Amenities – Available facilities (e.g., parking, swimming pool, gym)

Property Age – Age of the building in years

Price – Target variable (in currency units)

You can use a real-world dataset from Kaggle or a sample CSV file for testing.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

NumPy – Numerical computations

Pandas – Data manipulation

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning models & metrics

📊 Machine Learning Approach
Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values

Encode categorical variables

Normalize/scale numerical features

Model Training

Train-Test split (e.g., 80%-20%)

Train a Linear Regression model (or other algorithms)

Model Evaluation..

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
